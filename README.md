# Comparison-of-Pre-Trained-Image-Classifiers-Resnet-Alexnet-VGG

For this image classification task, we used an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (CNN).
CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images.
We used a CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet. There are different types of CNNs that have
different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project, we explore the three different
architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and determine which is best for our application.
